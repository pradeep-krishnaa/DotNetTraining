- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Encapsulation

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Tasks Implemented

1. **Base Class - `Book`**
   - Common properties:
     - `Id` (int)
     - `Title` (string)
     - `Author` (string)
     - `IsAvailable` (bool)

2. **Derived Classes**
   - `Fiction`:

     - Additional Property: `Genre` (string)
   - `NonFiction`:

3. **Interface - `IRentable`**
   - Methods:
     - `Rent()`
     - `Return()`
     - `ReportStatus()`

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Overridden `Display()` method in both `Fiction` and `NonFiction` classes.

5. **Service Layer**
   - Interface: `IBookService`
     - `DisplayAll()`
     - `ReportAll()`
   - Implementation: `BookService` class handles collection and operations on books.

6. **Program.cs Implementation**
   - Added 1 Fiction and 1 Non-Fiction book
